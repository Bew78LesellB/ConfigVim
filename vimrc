"###### DEFAULT INDENTATION ######
set tabstop=4
set softtabstop=4
set shiftwidth=4
set noexpandtab


" 'tabstop' changes the width of the TAB character, plain and simple.
"
" 'softtabstop' affects what happens when you press the <TAB> or <BS> keys. Its default value is the same as the value of 'tabstop', but when using indentation without hard tabs or mixed indentation, you want to set it to the same value as 'shiftwidth'. If 'expandtab' is unset, and 'tabstop' is different from 'softtabstop', the <TAB> key will minimize the amount of spaces inserted by using multiples of TAB characters. For instance, if 'tabstop' is 8, and the amount of consecutive space inserted is 20, two TAB characters and four spaces will be used.
"
" 'shiftwidth' affects what happens when you press >>, << or ==. It also affects how automatic indentation works. (See below.)
"
" 'expandtab' affects what happens when you press the <TAB> key. If 'expandtab' is set, pressing the <TAB> key will always insert 'softtabstop' amount of space characters. Otherwise, the amount of spaces inserted is minimized by using TAB characters.
"
" 'smarttab' affects how <TAB> key presses are interpreted depending on where the cursor is. If 'smarttab' is on, a <TAB> key inserts indentation according to 'shiftwidth' at the beginning of the line, whereas 'tabstop' and 'softtabstop' are used elsewhere. There is seldom any need to set this option, unless it is necessary to use hard TAB characters in body text or code.
